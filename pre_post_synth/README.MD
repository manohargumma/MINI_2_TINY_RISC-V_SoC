# SoC Pre-Synthesis & Post-Synthesis Verification


## 🔹 Pre-Synthesis Simulation

### **Definition**

Pre-synthesis simulation is the process of verifying the **functional correctness of a design at the RTL (Register Transfer Level)** before any logic synthesis is performed.

At this stage, the design is described using **behavioral and structural Verilog constructs** such as `always` blocks, `if-else`, `case` statements, and registers.

---

### **Purpose of Pre-Synthesis Simulation**

* Validate the **intended functionality** of the design
* Ensure correct **clock and reset behavior**
* Detect logical errors early in the design cycle
* Verify module integration before synthesis

---

### **Characteristics**

* Uses **RTL source files**
* No technology-specific cells are involved
* Timing delays are ideal (zero delay)
* Simulation focuses purely on **functionality**

---

### **Tools Used**

* Icarus Verilog (iverilog)
* GTKWave (waveform viewing)

---



### **In This Project**

In this project, pre-synthesis simulation was performed on the **Tiny RISC-V SoC RTL** to verify:

* Proper reset and clock operation
* Stable signal behavior without unknown states
* Correct integration of CPU, memory, and peripherals

```

### **Conclusion (Pre-Synthesis)**

Pre-synthesis simulation ensures that the RTL design is **functionally correct and ready for synthesis**, reducing the risk of errors propagating into later stages of the ASIC flow.

---

## 🔹 Post-Synthesis Simulation

### **Definition**

Post-synthesis simulation is the process of verifying the design **after logic synthesis**, using the **gate-level netlist** generated by the synthesis tool.

The RTL is replaced by a network of **technology-specific standard cells**, making this stage closer to the actual hardware implementation.

---

### **Purpose of Post-Synthesis Simulation**

* Ensure synthesis did not alter the design’s functionality
* Verify correct mapping of RTL logic to standard cells
* Detect synthesis-related issues such as missing resets or unintended logic changes
* Confirm equivalence between RTL and synthesized design

---

### **Characteristics**

* Uses **gate-level netlist**
* Includes **standard cell models** from the PDK
* Timing delays may be ignored (functional simulation)
* Focuses on **structural and functional correctness**

---

### **Tools Used**

* Icarus Verilog (functional gate-level simulation)
* Sky130 standard cell Verilog models
* GTKWave (waveform viewing)

---

### **In This Project**

Post-synthesis simulation was performed using the **synthesized netlist generated by OpenLane** and **Sky130 standard cell libraries**.
The observed behavior matched the pre-synthesis RTL simulation, confirming that the synthesis process preserved functional correctness.

---

### **Note on Timing Warnings**

During post-synthesis simulation, timing-related warnings may appear due to limited timing support in Icarus Verilog. These warnings originate from standard cell timing specifications and do not affect functional verification.

---

### **Conclusion (Post-Synthesis)**

Post-synthesis simulation confirms that the synthesized gate-level design behaves identically to the original RTL, ensuring readiness for physical design stages.

## 🔹 Overall Importance

> Performing both pre-synthesis and post-synthesis simulations ensures a robust and reliable ASIC design flow by validating functionality before and after synthesis. This methodology follows industry best practices and academic tapeout programs.
